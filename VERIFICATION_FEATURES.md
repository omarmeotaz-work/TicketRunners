This document describes the new phone OTP verification and email verification features added to the profile settings tab.

## Overview

Two new verification components have been added to enhance security and user verification:

1. **Phone OTP Verification** - Verifies phone numbers using SMS OTP codes
2. **Email Verification** - Verifies email addresses using email links

## Integration

Both components are integrated into the Profile page settings tab (`src/pages/Profile.tsx`):

2. **Event Handlers:** Added handlers for verification success and value changes
3. **UI Updates:** Replaced basic input fields with verification components
4. **Save Functionality:** Updated save button to use new state management

## User Experience

### Phone Verification Flow:

## Demo Mode

Both components include demo/simulation functionality:

## Styling

Components use the existing design system:

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production use:
1. Real API integration for OTP sending and verification
2. Rate limiting and security measures
3. Internationalization for different regions
4. More sophisticated validation rules
5. Integration with backend user management system
